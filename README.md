## Scenario

Coolpay is a new company that allows to easily send money to friends through their API.

You work for Fakebook, a successful social network. Youâ€™ve been tasked to integrate Coolpay inside Fakebook. A/B tests show that users prefer to receive money than pokes!

You can find Coolpay documentation here: http://docs.coolpayapi.apiary.io/

You will write a small app that uses Coolplay API in Ruby. The app should be able do the following:



### User stories

```
As a User
I want to be able to Authenticate to Coolpay API
So other people cannot send my money

As a User
I want to be able to Add recipients
So I can list my friends easily

As a User
I want to be able to Send Money
So I can save time by not using my bank

As a User
I want to be send a confirmation message when a payment is successful
So that I'm not worrying about losing money
```
